Not so serious & just for fun xD

But here is something to notice.
1. Your password will be **encrypted** and stored on my server. So your password will be secured without anyone (including me) being able to decrypt it.
2. All data transfers in this website are all through **HTTPS connection**, which is currently believed the most secured and uncrackable.
3. This account is used and only used while commenting and rating for visitors. I don't think there is much to do for a simple personal blog.
4. I promise that I will **never** leak account info intentionally (But I can't guarantee it since catastrophic accidents may happen).
5. Server and database may change **frequently** and **without advance notification**. Your account info may be lost at any time.

That is all what you need to know.
