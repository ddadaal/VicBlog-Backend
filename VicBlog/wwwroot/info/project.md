At the time when Internet was just starting to develop, computers were not owned by everyone, and ActiveX and Flash were fresh and applied all over the Internet, personal blog was something fashional for Internet users. They were used to writing something on the blogs, with pictures, and decorated them with varieties of themes. Some bloggers simply recorded their personal lives as what we do now in social media. Some dalaos filled their blogs with knowledge. And some dalaos even styled their blogs with tons of animations, colors and weird shapes at the time when HTML5/CSS3 didnâ€™t exist and network speed was poor, impressing the viewers most of whom were just new to this fancy world. 

**I always wanted to have a personal blog.** 

I tried to find the blog that suits me from online providers, 
like `wordpress`, `lofter`, even `QQZone`, 
but I always felt not satisfied. 

**How about building and maintaing the blog BY MYSELF?**

- I would never be limited by functions, themes or costs. 
- I could implement whatever functions I want, decorated whatever I want, and kept up with the rapidly developing technical trend. 

**But it is so hard!!!**

1. I just heard of FrontPage 2003, Dreamweaver.
2. What is HTML, CSS and JavaScript?
3. PHP, Python, C#, Java... What should I learn?

So, I slowed down.

*Sept 2, 2013, Chongqing*: 

> I am now in senior high school. I should spend more time on study.

*At weenkends, home*:

> I am too tired this week. I need to relax.

*Sept 1, 2015, campus*: 

> I am in Grade 3 of Senior High School. I think I should put programming aside.

*Mar 20, 2016, campus*: 

> I am 18.

*June 8, 2016, home*: 

> College Entrance Examination is done. High school is gone.

*Aug 26, 2016, home*: 

> I packed my luggage and boarded the plane leaving Chongqing, saying goodbye to my sweet home.

*Aug 28, 2016, Nanjing*: 

> I am now a student of NJU.
 
And suddenly, I found that **I had done nothing** in the past three years.

After getting used to the life in school, I spent one winter vacation on this VicBlog,

which works now, if you can read this article.

It seems that my long-lasting dream finally comes true. 

> **Dreams and desires can't never be completely satisfied.**

It just works now, but **bugs**, **new features**, **new technologies** drives me to work on it as long as I am alive.

**And I am no longer a young, carefree child.**
